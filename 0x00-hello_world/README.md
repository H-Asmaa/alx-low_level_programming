<h2>1. Compiler</h2>
<h4>A script that compiles a C file but does not link.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE</li>

<p>Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE</li>
<li>The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.</li>
<p>Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
</ul>

<h2>3. Name</h2>
<h4>A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Hello, puts</h2>

<li>You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Intel</h2>
